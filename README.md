# TechDegree-Unit-3
This project was focused on building a sign up form using HTML, CSS, Javascript (primarily with a jquery library). 
Sections:

# 1. Basic info
With the basic info, the main objective was mainly to simply hide the "Other" role on page load. Then show the other role when the option is selected. After the refactor this was able to be done with an event listener ('change') and a ternary operator.

# 2. T-shirt info
With the t-shirt info, it was all about a making sure the right color options are shown for the correct design option. The techniques used for this were: array looping with .each(), ternary operators, array filtering with .not() 
# 3. Activities info

# 4. Payment info
